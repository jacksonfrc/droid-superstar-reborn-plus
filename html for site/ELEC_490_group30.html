<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The primary objective of the Mobile Application Development Toolkit outlined in

this report is to create an alternative tool that simplifies the process of building an

Android application, more specifically the user interface aspect of said Android

application. By simplifying this process, development of Android applications can be

opened to a broader audience. The key points of this as an objective are minimal

design, accessibility, easy to learn for new users, a swift workflow, and that it is not

lacking any required functionality. Although novice developers are targeted as our

primary audience it was our goal was to satisfy this audience while keeping the

application extensive enough to also be of help to users with appropriate technical

knowledge.
</p>

<p>
A second objective of the application was complete integration of the toolkit with

Android. This means that projects created within the toolkit should be able to be run on

Android devices of all variations and files exported from the toolkit should be editable

within Android Studio and/or other development environments. This objective was

divided into two components: front-end functionality for Android (essentially what the

user sees) and back-end functionality for android (what makes the mobile application

function behind the scenes). Of these two components front-end functionality was

determined to be of higher importance due to the nature of the toolkit and its focus on

user interface design. Back end functionality acted as a stretch goal.</p>


<p>Development tools currently available are tailored to the experienced user and

offer hundreds of tools that a user with little experience can find confusing and have

issues deciphering. In addition to the issues surrounding the actual development

application we must realize that the problem is an inherently technical issue due to the

field that it exists within. There will be no way to completely solve the matter because a

certain amount of technical knowledge in the realm of computing or computer science,

albeit minimal, will always be required to confidently operate any form of tool used in

Android design and development.</p>

<h2>Design and Development</h2>

<p>The final design of the product underwent multiple iterations of prototyping and

live changes. The first stage prototype was created using an online UI creation tool for

the project proposal, this was the beginning of the design process. As the design

process progressed we opted for a faster and easier way to refine our UX design by

creating paper prototypes. During group meetings we would brainstorm functionality and

design on a white board as this allowed for numerous small changes to be made

throughout the meeting, once we were happy with the design we would draw the design

on paper as this is more reflective of the scale and use of the application. Paper

prototyping is commonly used in software development as it is a cheap and fast method

of prototyping that produces a tangible result, we found this type of prototyping to be

quite effective as our final design closely resembles the final prototype.</p>

<p>Development of Android Superstar was done using the Electron framework, an open

source cross platform architecture for creating desktop applications with web

technologies. The source of the application is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

which is then rendered in a lightweight chromium instance. Chromium is Google's open

source version of their Chrome browser, the browser acts as a virtual machine to render

the source code but doesn't require an internet connection as all of the data is stored

locally in the application. Allowing all computers capable of running the chromium

browser, to run our application, which are all modern operating systems. Chromium

maintains a lightweight build and is not CPU intensive allowing our application to run

smoothly on all computers and will not cause interference with other tasks running

simultaneously.</p>


<p>The main deployment of Android Superstar will be a cross platform desktop application

in the form of an executable for Windows, Mac and Linux available for download from

the product's website. Since the project will remain open source, more advanced users

have the option of downloading and manually running the source code with Electron. In

the future we would like to port the application over to a website, allowing for users to

quickly and easily build Android applications from their browser, this would broaden the

potential user base of the application. Similar to any other software project we will

continue with rolling releases & bug fixes, and slowly integrating more advanced

Android functionality.</p>


<h2>Testing and Results</h2>
<p>Testing for the Android Superstar application consisted of two parts, first part

being functional testing and second being requirements testing. Functional testing

ensures that the program itself works. It tests for any bugs and/or glitches that may

occur when using the software. Requirements testing ensures that the program works

the way that it is supposed to. In other words, this second type of testing ensures that all

the requirements laid out in the planning stage of the application are met and that the

project is not going off track.</p>

<p>During testing, failures were fixed by going into the code and forcing console

outputs to show what was being outputted. This console output also helped pinpoint

where in the code the error may lie. Once fixed, the tests were run again to ensure that

no other functionality had broken due to the changes that were made.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic; text-align:center">Result of XML output from Android Superstar in Android Studio</p>

<p>While Android Superstar still has a few bugs, it is, for the most part, a complete

application. It can easily build Android GUIs and web application GUIs by dragging and

dropping components. The design itself is quite reliable and robust. It does not break

when building or outputting applications. As shown in figure 5, the XML file is being

outputted correctly and that the positioning and color scheme is being executed

correctly. Figure 6 shows that the web application is correctly displayed on the Chrome

Browser when outputted as an HTML file.</p>


<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All contributors to the project believe finances should not hold someone back

from using our product. Therefore, all parts of Android Superstar will be subject to the

Apache 2.0 software license. The licence states that anyone may use or manipulate

the application as they please for free. This allows users to generate their own

applications and these applications may also be used for commercial purposes.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, an application that builds both web and Android GUIs was built.

The initial goals were to build an application that can allow novice developers to build

fully functioning Android applications. As time went on, the goals were modified to

create an application that helps novice developers to build Android and web application

GUIs. Constraints such as time and scheduling conflicts due to other course work were

mostly overcome and managed. In the future, we would like to increase the amount of

GUI components that are available to the user. Also, we would like to add more

functionality, such as a camera feature, to Android Superstar. Android Superstar is

forever a work in progress, but we hope it will be deemed helpful by its users.</p>
